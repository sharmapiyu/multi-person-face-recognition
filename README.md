# Multi-Person Face Recognition 🎯

This project is a **Multi-Person Face Recognition System** built using **YOLOv11, OpenCV, and Python**.  
It detects and recognizes multiple faces in real-time from webcam or video streams.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time detection** of multiple faces using YOLOv11
- **Face recognition** by comparing embeddings with a stored dataset
- **Works with webcam or video files**
- **Scalable** – add more faces easily to the dataset
- **Jupyter Notebook support** for step-by-step experimentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **YOLOv11** (for object/face detection)
- **OpenCV** (video stream handling & image preprocessing)
- **face_recognition / dlib** (for face encoding & matching)
- **Jupyter Lab / Notebook** (for training & testing)
- **NumPy / Pandas** (data handling)
